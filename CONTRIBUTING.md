# Welcome to the project!

This project is a sandbox for my personal use. I am grateful for suggestions and feedback in general.

## Discuss the project

Feel free to use the _discussion_ feature here on GitHub.

## Create pull requests

People who wish to contribute to the code repository should in general create pull requests. Some changes, including bugfixes and improvements on the documentation can be implemented directly. More substantial changes should have a bit of a design phase to produce a consensus about the pending change. Generally: if, and only if, I like the change, I will accept the pull request. To increase the chance of a successful review, contributors are encouraged to discuss planned changes in advance.

### Branch organization

Changes should be submitted to the `main` branch. Instead of having a multi-stage branching system, we keep it simple and try to keep the `main` branch as healthy as possible. You can submit partial changes if you want, as long as these changes meet the quality goals.

## License

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT license.

## Everything else

Other forms of contribution are welcome as well. Just start a _discussion_ and propose whatever it is that you would like to contribute.
